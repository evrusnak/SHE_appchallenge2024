## What did we do?
Urban expansion has so many levels, so we decided to tackle vertical expansion, and because we are environmental scientists, we thought about how important it is to build BIRD FRIENDLY CITIES! So our team's goal was to map the bird-building strike risk in Toronto, and create an interactive app that citizens can use to view high-risk bird strike zones. The users can search by address, and are shown the overall risk of bird-strikes as well as the highest risk factors in that area. We also included some great resources to actions that help reduce bird strikes!
